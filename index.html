        <br>
        <p>Darwin Raglan Caspian Ahab Poseidon Nicodemius Watterson, III (voiced by Kwesi Boakye in seasons 1–3, Terrell Ransom Jr. in seasons 3–5, Donielle T. Hansley Jr. in seasons 5–6, and Christian J. Simon in season 6 onward) is a 10-year-old orange goldfish who is Gumball's best friend adopted by the Watterson family. Initially given to Gumball as a pet, Darwin later sprouted legs and subsequently became a full member of the Watterson family. The series' first season depicted Darwin with a tendency to be more naive and gullible than others, due to his sudden introduction into the world; subsequent seasons established his more serious side, including the ability to think logically and, in "The Words", speak his mind freely.Although Gumball can sometimes be a negative influence on him, Darwin is extremely loyal to Gumball and often helps him out of sticky situations. He is sometimes shown to not exhibit normal behaviour, such as calling his adoptive parents Mr. Dad and Mrs. Mom.</p>

        <p id="font">I have other hobbies too, but I think Astronomy is my favorite. It always makes me feel like there is a 0.0000000001% chance that we are alone and there is no life out there just because there is so much more to explore. We as humans, always want to journey into the unknown.“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam."-Carl Sagan</p>

        <p class="align">I like Thomas Edison becasue he failed 10,000 times but on his next trial, he succeeded. If he didn't try just one more time, we may have not had electricty</p>
